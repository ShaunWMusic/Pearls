# pearls-beard-oil

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

Pearl's Beard Oil is a Christian-based company that was created after discovering there are no companies that have zero waste beard oil bottles. When you toss your bottle out, you are creating waste that is hazardous to the environment. But with some research, we found a way to correct it. Our mission is to help you grow a thick, full beard that youâ€™ve always wanted while also keeping the environment clean at an affordable price. Subscribe with us today to start helping yourself and the world at the same time.

We also believe that open sourcing our code is going to create the build tool
for our customers.
