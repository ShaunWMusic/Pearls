        will make the world a better place. I’m also over our web development, business development, and product development.
        Pearl’s Beard Oil is made up of three co-founders: Wanda Pearl Sears, Clinton Mullen and me(Shaun Willis). Wanda Pearl,
        my wife’s aunt, is our master mixer behind our amazing company. She is the mastermind behind creating our best smelling scents (and in the future unscented) on the market. Clinton, my wife’s sister’s
        husband, is our customer relations, Instagram post creator and brand development.<br>
        
        Pearl's Beard Oil is a Christian-based company that was created after discovering there are no beard oil companies that
        have zero waste beard oil products. When you toss your bottle out, you are creating waste that impacts the
        environment. But with some research, we found a way to help the evironment. Our mission is to help you grow a thick, full beard
        that you’ve always wanted while also keeping the environment clean at an affordable price. Subscribe with us today to
        start helping your beard and the environment become better.</p>
