        offer zero waste beard oil products. When you toss your bottle out, you are creating waste that impacts the
        environment. But with some research, we found a way to help the environment one subscription at a time. Our mission is
        to help you grow a thick, full beard that you’ve always wanted while also protecting the environment at an affordable
        price. Subscribe with us today. Your beard and the environment will be better for it.</p>
